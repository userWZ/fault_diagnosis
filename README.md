# Fault-Diagnosis

This repository is an framework for Fault-Diagnosis based on DeepLearning 


## Features
- [x] Supports reading multiple datasets, with built-in dataloader (currently includes CWRU, PU, HGD datasets).
- [x] Implements various fault diagnosis networks (including WDCNN, MIXCNN, MSCNN, etc.).
- [x] Provides a wide range of metric calculation methods (include acc, recall, f1, etc).
- [x] Offers various methods for classification visualization (include t-sne, Distribution histogram, Confusion matrices, Roc curve).
- [x] Implements flexible configuration of experiments based on Hydra.
- [x] Supports multi-GPU training.
- [x] Provides robust solutions for network continuation.
- [x] Integrates with TensorBoard or Weights & Biases for training monitoring.
